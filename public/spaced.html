        Spaced out was done with two classmates for my fourth project in my Web Development Immersive at General Assembly. I spent the previous week learning Ruby and Rails and had five days to complete a Ruby on Rails app with the PostgreSQL database. This task seemed <i>very</i> daunting at first, but after completing the project I can say I feel much more comfortable with both Ruby and Rails and I wouldn't hesitate to complete another project with these technologies.

        I really enjoy typography so I pitched the idea of creating a website where users can favorite fonts and can see other user's picks as well. I had not yet used an API so this was the perfect change to introduce myself to them. I pictured a clean and modern looking site with the focus on typography.
        <br><br>
        In the last group project, my group decided to divvy up the work and complete tasks independently, getting together when there was an issue we couldn’t resolve alone. This time around, we took a completely different approach and decided to work as one almost the entire time. We essentially did the entire project pair-programming. We were able set up our Ruby back-end and Angular front-end with one person sharing their screen and coding while the other two helped out and made sure no mistakes were being made. Although this method is definitely slower, we ran into very few errors and the errors we did run into were small bugs and pretty quick fixes. I believe that the pair-programming led to a very stress-free project week because we were able to take on tasks one a time in order and didn't move on until it was successfully built out.

        When deciding the user functionality and models, we decided to allow CRUD functionality to signed in users only. If you have not signed up to be a member of Spaced Out, you may only view the Fonts page. Once a visitor becomes a member, they have access to their Profile page. Here, the user can browse the Google Fonts API, type whatever they’d like into a text area and view it in real-time in whichever font they choose. The user can also change the size of the font and if they like the font and would like to remember it for future reference, they can favorite the font and it will show up in their Favorites list. The site has full CRUD functionality where the user can add to their Favorite Fonts, delete fonts, and update their user password and email address.
        <br><br>
        As a whole, this project was easygoing and the basic MVP was accomplished without any major setbacks. Because of the time constraints we weren't able accomplish all of our ideas, but we were able to complete our basic functionality with a simple and elegant-looking site. I believe this was due to our workflow process, the laid back yet hardworking nature of my team, and our thoroughness when setting up the foundation of our app.

        This site has the potential to grow and I plan on revisiting my work when time allows.
