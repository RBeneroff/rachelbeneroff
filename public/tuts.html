        Turn Up Time System was built for my third project in the Web Development Immersive at General Assembly. This was our first group project and our only guidelines were to build a MEAN Stack application with at least two models and authentication. My group took on this project with determination and successfully accomplished all our goals in the allotted time.
        <br><br>
        The idea for T.U.T.S was shaped from my dislike of time trackers that I have used in the past. I thought that you should be able to give your projects a description and even further break them into smaller tasks. As a group, we morphed this idea into a collaborative time tracker where teams can work on the same project or task and keep track of their individual time contributions at the same moment that a co-worker is also tracking their time. Each contributor can see how long a co-worker has worked on a task and how much time has been spent on a task or project overall.
        <br><br>
        We were only given four and a half days for this project so to be able to accomplish all that we had planned, we decided the best route was to split everything up and each person could tackle their own part. This proved to be a very efficient way of working because we were able to make huge strides every single day. Not all teams work best this way, but in my group, we all had the confidence and skill to take pieces of the project and merge them together later.

          In order to make this type of workflow successful, communication was key. We were posting in our Slack channel constantly, seeing if anyone was running into any problems, and deciding who would tackle what next. It was really incredible to see how much we were able to accomplish in just one afternoon.
          <br><br>
          That being said, there is always room for improvement. When I have time, I would like to go back and update the Dashboard graphs. This was the very last thing we accomplished and it was finished just before our presentation. Because it was such a last minute add, the design of the graphs is not up to my standard and with a few more hours I think it could be turned into something very impressive looking. I also believe the Dashboard has the potential to show all sorts of data in different types of graphs. For example, we could add a pie chart showing the percentage of time spent on each project or a graph comparing different user's data.
          <br><br>
          At the end of the project week, we had successfully implemented everything we planned on accomplishing. We were able to show live time updates, have a user mark a project as complete with ease (and vice versa), and created simple graphs that showed your userâ€™s contributions to each task and project. I am very happy with our resulting app and I took so much away from this group project.
