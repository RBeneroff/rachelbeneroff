      DRAFT ONE. A burger blog for a friend who prides himself on his extensive burger knowledge and Instagram pictures.

      For our second project, we had few guidelines but must meet the bare minimums of a working full-stack application using Node and Express with MongoDB and Mongoose. Our application must have at least 2 models with log in functionality and RESTful routing. With these guidelines I decided this would be the perfect chance to create one of the many websites I had promised people. (knock one off the list of the many people who ask for a website when they find out you’re taking a web development course.)

      This is a simple blog that allows an Admin to log in and create, edit, update and delete burgers posts. The Admin has full control of the content and it cannot be edited by other users. Visitors who come to the site have a choice of viewing the posts by restaurant name or by burger picture. If you enjoy Bok's Burger List, you can choose to sign up and receive an email every time a new burger is rated and posted on the site.

      With a week-long limit to this website build, I am left with many what-ifs and if-onlys. There are a number of elements that I’d like to go back to and tweak and a whole list of features that I would like to add to the site. A few of the features I’d like to add on are fully functional Google Map integration, add a Restaurant Model so that there can be many burgers per restaurant and add a whole new page that includes the “Bok Where I’ve Been and Where I Need to Go” checklist. Of course, I could go on and on about what I’d like to add but I am also very happy with my project results.
