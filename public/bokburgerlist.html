      A burger blog for a friend who prides himself on his extensive burger knowledge and Instagram pictures.
      <br><br>
      For my second project in my Web Development Immersive at General Assembly, I had to complete a working full-stack application using Node and Express with MongoDB and Mongoose. The application had to have at least two models with log-in functionality and RESTful routing. With these guidelines I decided this would be the perfect chance to create one of the many websites I had promised people.

      This is a simple blog that allows an administrator to log-in and create, edit, update and delete burgers posts. The admin has full control over the content and it cannot be edited by other users. Visitors who come to the site have a choice of viewing the posts by restaurant name or by burger picture and if you really enjoy Bok's Burger List, you can choose to sign up and receive an email every time a new burger is rated and posted on the site.
      <br><br>
      With a week-long limit to this website build, I was left with many what-ifs and if-only. There are a number of elements that I’d like to go back to and tweak and a whole list of features that I would like to add to the site. A few of them include: fully functional Google Map integration, adding a Restaurant Model so that there can be many burgers per restaurant, and add a new page that includes the “Bok Where I’ve Been and Where I Need to Go” checklist. I fully intent to keep this as a work-in-progress and keep contributing to this project as my skillset grows.
      <br><br>
      I am very happy with the way my very first CRUD and RESTful routing app turned out. When this project was assigned I only had one month of coding experience and I am extremely proud that I was able to accomplish this in one week.
