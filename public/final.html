        DRAFT ONE. Spaced out was done with two classmates for my fourth project in WDI. I spent one week learning Ruby and Rails and had five days to complete a Ruby on Rails app with PostgreSQL. I enjoy typography so I pitched the idea of creating a website where users can favorite fonts. I pictured a clean and modern looking site with the focus on typography.

        In the last group project, my group and I decided to divvy up the work and complete tasks independently, getting together when there was an issue we couldn’t solve alone. This time around, we decided to work as one almost the entire time and did a lot of pair-programming. We set up our entire Ruby back-end and Angular front-end with one person sharing their screen and coding while the other two helped out and made sure no mistakes were being made. Although this method is slower, we ran into very few errors and the errors we did run into were small bugs and fixes. I believe that the pair-programming led to a very easy project week.

        When deciding the user functionality and models, we decided to allow CRUD functionality to signed in users only. If you have not signed up to be a member of Spaced Out, you may only view the Fonts page. Once a visitor becomes a member, they have access to their Profile page. Here the user can browse the Google Fonts API, type whatever they’d like into a text area and view it in real-time in whichever font they choose. The user can also change the size of the font and if they like the font and would like to remember it for future reference, they can favorite the font and it will show up in their Favorites list. The site has full CRUD functionality where the user can add to their Favorite Fonts, delete fonts, and update their user password and email.

        As a whole, this project was easygoing and the basic MVP was accomplished without any major setbacks. I believe this was due to our workflow process, the laid back nature of my team (yet hardworking), and our thoroughness when setting up the foundation of our app.
