My Personal Website - under construction

www.rachelbeneroff.site

Technologies used: AngularJS, JS, HTML, CSS

## To Do:
- finish case studies/ design description
- DRY up word animations/transition duration

## Ideas:
- one page where nav bar stays at top and changes with page on
- navbar: can i make the underline slide?

### Work/Projects
- if keep all on one page - do link in head image that scrolls down to design and development when clicked
- do a wide screen image with description underneath
- link to site
- what I did, how I did it, technologies used, what I would have done differently
- try Stellar.js

General:
- text is serif
- headings, buttons are Hero
- make all text color #333333

Bugs to fix:
- (work) top scroll image jumps when first move on page
- onload -- slow load/images loading at different times
- about page is not centered? some weird margin on right of page
- Hero font is not carrying over to other people's browsers
- fix ui-sref-active so that work is underlined when design is chosen
